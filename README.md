# DeckTracker
Keeps track of my deck so I can know what cards I need to buy and what I already have

## Usage

Run the app using `go main.go <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>` and it'll run continuously, checking your Neodeck to see what cards you have and then the Collectable Card Shop to see what cards are in stock. It'll tell you what cards are in stock that you need. 

To end the program, just press Ctrl + C.

## ToDo
- Add in a Discord integration so I can get alerted without needing to watch the output
