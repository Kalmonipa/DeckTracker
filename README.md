# DeckTracker
Looks at what cards you have in your Neodeck and what is currently in the Collectable Card store so you can avoid duplicates.
Note: It doesn't do any buying or selling, just compares your cards to the store.

## Usage

Run the app using `go main.go <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>` and it'll run continuously, checking your Neodeck to see what cards you have and then the Collectable Card Shop to see what cards are in stock. It'll tell you what cards are in stock that you need. 

To end the program, just press Ctrl + C.

## ToDo
- Add in a Discord integration so I can get alerted without needing to watch the output
